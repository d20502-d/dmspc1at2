    <h2>Inspirations:</h2>
    <h3>Traditional Musical Instruments (Piano Keyboard):</h3>
    <p>
      The spatial layout and octave structure are inspired by the piano
      keyboard’s organization of notes and octaves. This familiar framework
      helps users intuitively understand the relationship between notes.
    </p>
    <h3>Grid-Based Layout (MIDI Grid Controllers):</h3>
    <p>
      I was also inspired by MIDI grid controllers, such as the Novation
      Launchpad and Ableton Push, which use a matrix of buttons arranged in rows
      and columns to trigger musical notes and samples. Similarly, my 5x3 button
      grid maps spatial positions to musical notes, providing a clear and
      playable visual representation of music.
    </p>
    <h3>Multiple Input Methods:</h3>
    <p>
      MIDI controllers often support various input methods, including pads,
      knobs, and buttons. Reflecting this versatility, my project supports
      mouse, touch, and keyboard inputs, allowing users to interact with the
      instrument in multiple ways and enhancing accessibility.
