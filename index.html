      <h2>Inspirations:</h2>
      <h3>Traditional Musical Instruments (Piano Keyboard):</h3>
      <p>
        The spatial layout and octave structure are inspired by the piano
        keyboard’s organization of notes and octaves. This familiar framework
        helps users intuitively understand the relationship between notes.
      </p>
      <h3>Grid-Based Layout (MIDI Grid Controllers):</h3>
      <p>
        I was also inspired by MIDI grid controllers, such as the Novation
        Launchpad and Ableton Push, which use a matrix of buttons arranged in
        rows and columns to trigger musical notes and samples. Similarly, my 5x3
        button grid maps spatial positions to musical notes, providing a clear
        and playable visual representation of music.
      </p>
      <h3>Multiple Input Methods:</h3>
      <p>
        MIDI controllers often support various input methods, including pads,
        knobs, and buttons. Reflecting this versatility, my project supports
        mouse, touch, and keyboard inputs, allowing users to interact with the
        instrument in multiple ways and enhancing accessibility.

      <h2>Project Conceptualisation</h2>
      <h3>Spatial Control:</h3>
      <p>5x3 grid layout</p>
      <h3>Visual Distinction of Octaves:</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Novel Input and Interaction:</h3>
      <p>Math.random()</p>
      <h3>Customize</h3>
      <p>settings</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
      <h3>UI Implementation:</h3>
      <p>
        HTML and CSS create the grid layout with semi-transparent squares,
        circular and diamond frames.
      </p>
      <h3>Audio Playback:</h3>
      <p>Web Audio API plays notes mapped to each button.</p>
      <h3>Advanced Technique:</h3>
      <p>
        Math.random() is used in the "Surprise Me" feature to select and play
        random notes.
      </p>
      <h3>Input Methods:</h3>
      <p>Supports mouse, touch, and keyboard inputs for accessibility.</p>
      <h3>Visual Feedback:</h3>
      <p>
        Pressed keys scale up and change color briefly to provide immediate
        feedback.
      </p>
      <h3>Settings Toggles:</h3>
      <p>
        Sliding toggle buttons control visibility of note names, keyboard
        display, and metronome activation.
