      <h2>Inspirations:</h2>
      <h3>Traditional Musical Instruments (Piano Keyboard):</h3>
      <p>
        The spatial layout and octave structure are inspired by the piano
        keyboard’s organization of notes and octaves. This familiar framework
        helps users intuitively understand the relationship between notes.
      </p>
      <h3>Grid-Based Layout (MIDI Grid Controllers):</h3>
      <p>
        I was also inspired by MIDI grid controllers, such as the Novation
        Launchpad and Ableton Push, which use a matrix of buttons arranged in
        rows and columns to trigger musical notes and samples. Similarly, my 5x3
        button grid maps spatial positions to musical notes, providing a clear
        and playable visual representation of music.
      </p>
      <h3>Multiple Input Methods:</h3>
      <p>
        MIDI controllers often support various input methods, including pads,
        knobs, and buttons. Reflecting this versatility, my project supports
        mouse, touch, and keyboard inputs, allowing users to interact with the
        instrument in multiple ways and enhancing accessibility.

      <h2>Project Conceptualisation</h2>
      <h3>Spatial Control:</h3>
      <p>
        The interface uses a clear 5x3 grid layout to represent musical notes,
        mapping spatial positions directly to piano scales. This spatial
        arrangement helps users visually and physically understand the
        relationships between notes and octaves, making the musical experience
        more intuitive and engaging.
      </p>
      <h3>Visual Distinction of Octaves:</h3>
      <p>
        By visually distinguishing the first note of each octave with an
        additional diamond-shaped frame, the design conceptually emphasizes
        musical structure and hierarchy, aiding user orientation within the note
        grid.
      </p>
      <h3>Novel Input and Interaction:</h3>
      <p>
        While maintaining accessibility through traditional input methods
        (mouse, touch, keyboard), the project introduces a unique keyboard
        layout and a “Surprise Me” feature that plays random notes using
        Math.random(). This adds an element of playfulness and exploration,
        encouraging users to interact with the instrument in unexpected ways.
      </p>
      <h3>Customize</h3>
      <p>
        The settings panel allows users to toggle the display of note names,
        keyboard visualization, and a metronome, giving control over the
        interface’s complexity and aiding different learning or playing styles.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
      <h3>UI Implementation:</h3>
      <p>
        HTML and CSS create the grid layout with semi-transparent squares,
        circular and diamond frames.
      </p>
      <h3>Audio Playback:</h3>
      <p>Web Audio API plays notes mapped to each button.</p>
      <h3>Advanced Technique:</h3>
      <p>
        Math.random() is used in the "Surprise Me" feature to select and play
        random notes.
      </p>
      <h3>Input Methods:</h3>
      <p>Supports mouse, touch, and keyboard inputs for accessibility.</p>
      <h3>Visual Feedback:</h3>
      <p>
        Pressed keys scale up and change color briefly to provide immediate
        feedback.
      </p>
      <h3>Settings Toggles:</h3>
      <p>
        Sliding toggle buttons control visibility of note names, keyboard
        display, and metronome activation.
      </p>

      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <h3>
        How intuitive is the spatial layout of the musical notes? Does the 5x3
        grid help you understand the note progression and octave boundaries?
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Is the visual distinction of octave-startin g notes (diamond shape)
        clear and helpful? Does it assist in navigating the musical scale?
      </h3>
      <h3>
        How responsive and natural does the audio playback feel when pressing
        the buttons? Are there any delays or issues with sound quality?
